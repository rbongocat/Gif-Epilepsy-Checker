# Program checks for if GIF is potentially epileptic.

Requirements:
1) Python 3 (Recommended 3.6+)
2) PIL and imagehash library (pip install pillow, pip install imagehash).


The program will now automatically create a folder called GIF in the directory the .py file is in.


Steps:
1) Put the .gif file in the same directory as the .py file.
2) Run the .py file.
3) Input the name of the .gif file.
4) Read output.
